Question	Answer
What is a cryptocurrency?	A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates on a decentralized network called blockchain.
How do I buy cryptocurrency?	You can buy cryptocurrency from online exchanges or trading platforms using fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies. Some popular exchanges include Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken.
What is an airdrop?	An airdrop is a distribution of cryptocurrency tokens or coins to a large number of wallet addresses for free or as a reward for completing certain tasks.
How can I participate in an airdrop?	To participate in an airdrop, you typically need to follow the instructions provided by the project issuing the tokens, which may include joining their social media channels, completing KYC (Know Your Customer) verification, or holding a specific cryptocurrency in your wallet.
What is KYC?	KYC stands for Know Your Customer, which is a process used by financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges to verify the identity of their customers to prevent fraud and comply with regulations.
What is a wallet?	A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital tool used to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies. Wallets can be software-based (hot wallets) or hardware-based (cold wallets).
What is the difference between a hot wallet and a cold wallet?	A hot wallet is connected to the internet and is more convenient for frequent transactions, while a cold wallet is not connected to the internet and offers better security for long-term storage of cryptocurrencies.
What is a private key?	A private key is a secret alphanumeric code that allows you to access and control your cryptocurrency holdings in a wallet. It should be kept confidential and never shared with anyone.
What is a public key?	A public key is a cryptographic address used to receive cryptocurrencies. It is derived from the private key but can be shared openly with others to receive payments.
What is a blockchain?	A blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger technology that records all transactions across a network of computers in a secure and transparent manner.
How does blockchain ensure security?	Blockchain ensures security through cryptographic techniques such as hashing, consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), and decentralized validation of transactions by network participants.
What is the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum?	Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency and primarily functions as a digital currency for peer-to-peer transactions, while Ethereum is a blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).
What is a smart contract?	A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. It automatically executes and enforces the terms of the contract when predefined conditions are met.
What is a decentralized exchange (DEX)?	A decentralized exchange is a cryptocurrency exchange platform that operates without a central authority or intermediary. It allows users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other using smart contracts.
What is a token?	In the context of cryptocurrencies, a token is a digital asset issued on a blockchain that represents ownership of a specific asset, utility, or right. Tokens can represent anything from currency to voting rights in a decentralized organization.
What is ICO?	ICO stands for Initial Coin Offering, which is a fundraising method used by cryptocurrency projects to raise capital by selling their native tokens to investors in exchange for fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies.
What is DeFi?	DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance, which refers to a movement that aims to recreate traditional financial systems (such as lending, borrowing, and trading) using blockchain technology and without intermediaries.
What is staking?	Staking is the process of actively participating in transaction validation (similar to mining) on a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. Users can stake their cryptocurrency holdings to help secure the network and earn rewards.
What is yield farming?	Yield farming is a practice in decentralized finance (DeFi) where users leverage various DeFi protocols to maximize their returns on cryptocurrency holdings through strategies such as lending, borrowing, and providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges.
